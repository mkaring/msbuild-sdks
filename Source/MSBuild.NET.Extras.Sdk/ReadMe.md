# MSBuild.NET.Extras.Sdk

## Summary

This package contains a few extra extensions to the SDK-style projects that are currently not available in `Microsoft.NET.Sdk` SDK. This feature is tracked in [dotnet/sdk#491](/dotnet/sdk/issues/491)

The primary goal of this project is to enable multi-targeting without you having to enter in tons of properties within your `csproj`, `vbproj`, `fsproj`, thus keeping it nice and clean.

See the [original project](/onovotny/MSBuildSdkExtras/) and this [blog article](https://oren.codes/2017/01/04/multi-targeting-the-world-a-single-project-to-rule-them-all/) by [Oren Novotny](/onovotny) for some background on how to get started.

### Getting started

1. Create a new .NET Standard class library or use your exisiting SDK-style project.
2. Install `MSBuild.NET.Extras.Sdk` package (adds the missing properties so that you can use any TFM you want.).
3. Then you can edit the `TargetFramework` to a different TFM, or you can rename `TargetFramework` to `TargetFrameworks` and specify multiple TFM's with a `;` separator.

After that, you can use the `Restore`, `Build`, `Pack` targets to restore packages, build the project and create NuGet packages. E.g.: `msbuild /t:Pack ...`

### Important to Note

- It will only work with Visual Studio IDE (Windows/Mac) as it requires the desktop `msbuild` and the target Platform SDKs which are not cross platform.
- It might work in Visual Studio Code, but you have to configure build tasks in `launch.json` to use desktop `msbuild` to build.
- You must install the tools of the platforms you intend to build. For Xamarin, that means the Xamarin Workload; for UWP install those tools as well.

## Using the Package

To use this package, Install it from NuGet or manually add a `PackageReference` to your project file like this (latest version recommended):

```xml
<PackageReference Include="MSBuild.NET.Extras.Sdk" Version="1.0.0" PrivateAssets="All"/>
```

Setting `PrivateAssets="All"` means that this build-time package won't be added as a dependency to any packages you create by using the `Pack` target (`msbuild /t:Pack`).

Then, at the end of your project file, either `.csproj`, `.vbproj` or `.fsproj`, add the following `Import` just before the closing tag

```xml
<Import Project="$(MSBuildSdkExtrasDotNet)" Condition="Exists('$(MSBuildSdkExtrasDotNet)')"/>
```

This last step is required until [Microsoft/msbuild#1045](/Microsoft/msbuild/issues/1045) is resolved.

## Targeting UWP

If you plan to target UWP, then you must include the UWP meta-package in your project as well, something like this:

```xml
<ItemGroup Condition="'$(TargetFramework)' == 'uap10.0'">
  <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.NETCore.UniversalWindowsPlatform" Version="6.0.1"/>
</ItemGroup>
```

Starting with Visual Studio 2017 Update 4 (aka _v15.4_), you can specify the `TargetPlatformMinVersion` with the TFM. The exact value depends on your installed Windows SDK. It may be something like `uap10.0.16299`. You can even multi-target to support older versions too, so have a `uap10.0` and `uap10.0.16299` (supports .NET Standard 2.0) target with different capabilities.

## Targeting Tizen

If you plan to target Tizen, then you should include the following meta-package:

```xml
<ItemGroup Condition="'$(TargetFramework)' == 'tizen30'">
  <PackageReference Include="Tizen.NET" Version="3.0.0"/>
</ItemGroup>
```

## Single or multi-targeting

Once this package is configured, you can now use any supported TFM in your `TargetFramework` or `TargetFrameworks` element. The supported TFM families are:

- `netstandard` (.NET Standard)
- `net` (.NET Framework)
- `net35-client`/`net40-client` (.NET Framework legacy Client profile)
- `netcoreapp` (.NET Core App)
- `wpa` (Windows Phone App 8.1)
- `win` (Windows 8 / 8.1)
- `uap` (UWP)
- `wp` (Windows Phone Silverlight, WP7+)
- `sl` (Silverlight 4+)
- `tizen` (Tizen 3.0+)
- `monoandroid`/`Xamarin.Android`
- `xamarinios` / `Xamarin.iOS`
- `xamarinmac` / `Xamarin.Mac`
- `xamarinwatchos` / `Xamarin.WatchOS`
- `xamarintvos` / `Xamarin.TVOS`
- `portableNN-`/`portable-` (legacy PCL profiles like `portable-net45+win8+wpa81+wp8`)

 For legacy PCL profiles, the order of the TFM's in the list does not matter but the profile must be an exact match to one of the known profiles. If it's not, you'll get a compile error saying it's unknown. You can see the full list of known profiles here: [Portable Library Profiles by Stephen Cleary](https://portablelibraryprofiles.stephencleary.com/).

 If you try to use a framework that you don't have tools installed for, you'll get an error as well saying to check the tools. In some cases this might mean installing an older version of Visual Studio IDE (_like 2015_) to ensure that the necessary targets are installed on the machine.
